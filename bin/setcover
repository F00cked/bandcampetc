# Frontend for eyeD3, which is a bit too violent with --add-image and
# --remove-images (it accepts about any type of file and it can corrupt stuff).
# While eyeD3, when called on a directory, seems to process every file in it,
# this script only tries to do stuff with '*.mp3' / '*.MP3'.
# Note that if metaflac is installed, FLAC files will be processed too.


# Get the name of the directory the current script sits in.

  $(basename "$0"): Set cover art for MP3 and FLAC files.

  Tag FILE with PICTURE (removing existing ones from FILE):
    ${prog} FILE PICTURE

  Run on every MP3 and FLAC file directly within DIRECTORY:
    ${prog} DIRECTORY PICTURE

  Remove pictures from FILE:
    ${prog} FILE ''
